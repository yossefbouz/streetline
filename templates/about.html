            <p class="body-font text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">“In a world overflowing with noise — trends, influencers, fast fashion, and mass-produced ‘aesthetics’ — people have lost their sense of identity. Music used to be personal. Clothing used to mean something.</p>
            <p class="body-font text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">People no longer know what represents them.<br>Fashion feels disconnected from culture.<br>Music tastes don’t show up in what people wear.<br>Everything looks the same.<br>Identity feels confused, temporary, and disposable.</p>
            <p class="body-font text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">There is no brand that connects music lovers, car enthusiasts, and culture-driven individuals to clothing that reflects who they really are. There is no easy place to buy clothing that carries meaning, story, and belonging. People want clothes that feel like them — not like another trend.”</p>

            <h2 class="heading-font text-2xl uppercase tracking-[0.12em] text-gray-100">Our Solution</h2>
            <p class="body-font text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">“DvStreetline gives people their identity back. We merge music × fashion × technology × culture to create clothing that carries story, emotion, and belonging.</p>
